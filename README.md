docker is no longer needed, redis is no longer used, no databases are used because the nodes themselves are the databases.
docker can be used(https://github.com/BitcoinJake09/CryptoPlugin/blob/main/Docker-readme), but the preferred way to run CryptoPlugin will be by downloading the stable release jar and configuring your .json file for your nodes.
it can be build from source and ran that way also.
